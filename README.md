# System Identification Technologies
The special purpose of system identification corresponds to identifying a mathematical model describing a relationship between the input and output of a real system. Recent developments in the field of system identification have provided effective and accurate analytical tools to solve challenging problems in system engineering and virtually in any application concerning models of dynamic systems. This project aims to present the fundamental algorithms of time-domain system identification for linear time-invariant systems.
